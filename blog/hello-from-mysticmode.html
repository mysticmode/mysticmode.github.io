    <p>While I'm writing this, I have a new found feeling that I'm going to share some experience and make a thoughtful
      impact for the readers. And as well, leave something worthwhile behind which might not vanish across time. I hope,
      this thought from me and this resource persists.</p>
    <p>Here, I'm going to write whatever thoughts, feelings and information that I could be able to put it into words.
      This just doesn't stick around that, I mean the spiritual aspects of me. But also, I'll be sharing some technical
      articles and tutorials that I learn. After all, my profession is writing softwares.</p>
