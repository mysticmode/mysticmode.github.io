          Today 20th, July 2023 marks 50 years since Bruce Lee's passing on
          1973. My father had told me about Bruce Lee, his speed, his efficacy
          and his life when I was a kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only at the very recent I started digging through his style and his
          teachings by reading about him and watching his videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is one thing I learned from this spectacular teacher, that
          should be - There is no limit in what you do, in what you pursue.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a blog post I wrote about him last year -
